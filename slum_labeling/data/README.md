Important Points:

1. gold_labels contains ground truth for 2k images for every image ID where 1 means a slum whereas a 0 denotes non-slum
2. Gold labels have been generated using some manual efforts based on some guidelines by UN as mentioned in the paper
3. The other folder contains 2k GeoTiff images in the format image_{ID} which is unique for every image and labeled accordingly.
