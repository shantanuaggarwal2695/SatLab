CNN: A simple convolutional neural network script with different parameters like batch size, lr, etc. Please change the parameters with different use-cases
DeepSAT: An essence of deepsat framework with unsupervised feature extraction using Deep Belief Networks followed by a supervised classification layer in form of Neural networks
DeepSAT_2: DeepSAT-2 framework with two different types of feature extraction : (1) CNN features (2) Handcrafter textural features
Rf: A simple random forest classifier trained using only the textural features from GeoTIFF images
